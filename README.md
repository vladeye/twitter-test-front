# TwitterTest

I used Angular-cli because is easy to generate new functionality besides angular allow bring data to the client
without rereshing the page.

My time: I spent 5 hours building the client, I had to use a sort of proxy made in nodejs as
I had problem with the CORS this is the repository: https://github.com/vladeye/twitter-test-back

From the architecture point of view I develope mostly dump components, concentrating the bussiness rules just
en a few of them, this allow me recicle the components if I need to

Developing the back took me 4 hours it makes a search of the latest tweets and create a stream sending back to the
client the next tweets.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
